Give the sid (a number):21103026
Enter your name:chirag
give a letter y or n:y
Give the sid (a number):21103028
Enter your name:aakash
give a letter y or n:n
The required dictionary-- {21103026: 'chirag', 21103028: 'aakash'}
The list will be used in further parts--
The required list-- [(21103026, 'chirag'), (21103028, 'aakash')]
----------------(b)------------------------
The dictionary we had-
{21103026: 'chirag', 21103028: 'aakash'}
now we have exchanged the key value pair but its not sorted-
{'chirag': 21103026, 'aakash': 21103028}
The unsorted list--
[('chirag', 21103026), ('aakash', 21103028)]
The sorted list--
[('aakash', 21103028), ('chirag', 21103026)]
The sorted dictionary-
{'aakash': 21103028, 'chirag': 21103026}
This is the dictionary sorted on the basis of name-
{21103028: 'aakash', 21103026: 'chirag'}
-----------------(c)-----------------
The list we made before will be used now-
[(21103026, 'chirag'), (21103028, 'aakash')]
now the list is sorted-
[(21103026, 'chirag'), (21103028, 'aakash')]
sorted dictionary based on sid- {21103026: 'chirag', 21103028: 'aakash'}
